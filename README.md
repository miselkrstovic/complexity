# Time and Space Complexity

We have an array of numbers containing **n + k** numbers where each number is between **1** and **n** and **k** is also between **1** and **n**. There can be only one duplicate number in the array. Find the duplicate number.
 
**Example:**<br>
Input: [1,2,4,3,5,2]<br>
Output: 2
 
Input: [1,2,4,4,5,4,6,3]<br>
Output: 4
